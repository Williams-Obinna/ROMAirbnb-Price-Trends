**Airbnb Price Trends (Dashboard Analysis – Power BI)**

This project offers a detailed Power BI-based exploration into Airbnb rental pricing patterns across room types and guest capacities. It examines how pricing fluctuates based on service style (shared, private, etc.), the number of guests, and rental value ceilings, with a visual dashboard that makes insights instantly accessible.

•	Room types like tents and serviced apartments consistently show lower price points.
•	1-guest accommodations command disproportionately high rates.
•	Price does not scale linearly with guest capacity rates per person can decrease or fluctuate.
•	Some niche property types (e.g., treehouses) are undervalued relative to unique experience offerings.
